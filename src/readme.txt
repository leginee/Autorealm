Installation of AutoRealm Components

The easiest installation is making an own package (eg AutoRealm.dpk) and add all pas files to it
(You don't have to add the RecentMainMenu component, since this one became obsolete with the introduction of Toolbar2000)

Also install the Toolbar2000 components by jordan Russel (www.jrsoftware.org).
Read the license carefully. The toolbar2000 components can be used freely in non-commercial products, 
which means we are ok for Autorealm.
