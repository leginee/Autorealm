Where Are Things Now?</h2>
<p>We've tackled a lot of the lower hanging fruit, if you will. The code compiles, runs, and produces windows on the screen. The windows are built using wxWidgets XRC files, and as such are highly portable.</p>
<p>Some of the most important notes about this, though, are how the autorealm_wx module is itself structured. I had a devil of a time getting all of the pieces of the code together to make things work. As such, I structured things this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top Level<ul>
<li>CHANGELOG (self-explanatory)</li>
<li>COPYING.txt (copy of GPL)</li>
<li>Doxyfile (all code is being documented using Doxygen, to try and make it easier to read and update at a later date, and to help show inheritance hierarchies. This is the control file for Doxygen)</li>
<li>README (directions on how to get it, and how to build it)</li>
<li>doc (hand generated documentation, such as text files to describe everything)</li>
<li>extras (a small patch for wxWidgets which is needed for autorealm_wx)</li>
<li>src (the actual c++ source code for autorealm_wx)</li>
<li>ui-xrc (the directory holding the xrc files which are used to generate the ui)</li>
<li>prior (this directory holds a snapshot in time of the delphi version of autorealm)<ul>
<li>chmhelp (chm help files)</li>
<li>components (required components to build delphi autorealm)</li>
<li>delphi (the delphi version of autorealm, as of July 19)</li>
<li>install (installshield build stuff for autorealm)</li>
<li>textforms (the text editor version of the dfm files for autorealm, especially useful for just reading properties without having to resort to actually starting up Delphi)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="standards"></a>
Coding Rules / Standards</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Code which is not documented with Doxygen tags will not be accepted.</li>
<li>Code which leaves error messages when Doxygen is run will not be accepted.</li>
<li>Code which does not compile on both Windows and Linux will not be accepted. However, I've found myself that the code may well compile on Linux and fail on Windows due to #include files. I'll fix the errors that I can, because I really do want to accept new code.</li>
<li>All code needs to have liberal wxDebug statements (every couple of lines doesn't hurt). This will help developers as they trace down bugs, but will be compiled out of the release/production code automatically, so is still good for that, too.</li>
<li>Code which hard codes dialog windows will not be accepted. XRC files only.</li>
<li>I also want to make sure that the code will eventually support easy internationalization and localization. While the actual C++ code doesn't do that job very well yet, the XRC files go a long way towards fixing it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know that some of those rules might be annoying, but I think if you take a look at what's done so far, you'll see that it does work, and is pretty easy to deal with because of those rules.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="contributing"></a>
How Can You Contribute?</h2>
<p>Now, if anybody does want to work on a section of the program, please do. All I ask is that you let me know which one, so that I can mark it off as being worked on, to try and avoid duplication of effort.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="goals"></a>
What Are We Trying To Accomplish Right Now?</h2>
<p>I'm trying to do just a straight port of the code. Basically, I want to take the existing code, and do line for line ports where possible. Minor restructuring, yes, but I want the code to behave as identically as possible to the existing codebase. After the port is complete, I'm all for doing any major restructuring from there that people will feel needs doing. But up front, I want to have the same program, just re-written.</p>
<p>As a special note, the code was branched as of July 19, 2004. When the time comes, it will be necessary to pull a CVS diff of the autorealm module as of June 15, 2004 to current, and verify that any new code is present in the autorealm_wx module. </p>
