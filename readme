 This is a note what this repository is all about.

It contains various attempts usable as unuseable code of Autorealm.
see sourceforge for details on autorealm.

Why did I do this?
Because the Project is on hold, after the delphi code is not maintained, and an attemt to port the Programm failed twice.
Since there seem again some interest to continue development (by myself and others) i decided to give a clean aproach first.

So this repositary will contain its versions in different branches.
delphi will contain the delphi Code (working)
cpp contains the wxWidgets port, not finalized.
wxpython contains a aproach with python and wxWidgets. I am unaware what development status is of this.

Have Fun!
